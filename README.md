# Soldering Iron
* [TS80](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4244)<br>
The TS80 is a chic and smart soldering iron powered by USB Type-C and QC3.0 standard input. Normally we'd scoff at trying to power a soldering iron off of USB, but thanks to the new USB C standard, the power plug that's included is a 9V 2A so you get a reasonable ~20 Watts of power. So, this is the first USB iron we would feel comfortable stocking, its a nice iron, good enough for every-day use. We dig the slim pen iron (so comfortable to hold), adjustable temperature (oooh there's a OLED screen!), durable grounding cord, and fast heat-up (about 22 seconds)!
